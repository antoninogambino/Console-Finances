**Console Finances Javascript challenge week 4**

This is the challenge of week 4 of the BootCamp from University of Birmingham

**User Story**

In this challenge I had to develop a console finances using javascript coding. This was an opportunity for me to explore what javascript can do and how it works. Moreover, the object of this task was do develop some calculations using data provided. It was asked to use javascript coding to calculate:

- Total Months
- Total $
- Average Change
- Greatest Increase in Profits/Losses
- Greatest Decrease in Profits/Losses

**Technology**

This project was developed using only HTML and javascript files - with the addition of the README file.

**Acceptance Criteria**

This challenge was an opportunity to put in action what we have been discussed in the past week. Moreover, this challenge offered me an introduction to understand how to apply javascript and how it works. I still need to empower the concept but I am happy with the result. I followed the requirements which was requesting the following:

Financial Analysis 
  ----------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $38382578
  Average Change: -2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits/Losses: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits/Losses: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)

  I had here an opportunity to deeply research how to get this executed even though I could not figure out on how to make the "Greatest Decrease in Profits/Losses" to match the value that it was requested to find.

  I would need to look into this even more and make sure I understand javascript 100% - Currently I am at the beginning of learning and understanding the concept of this type of coding.
